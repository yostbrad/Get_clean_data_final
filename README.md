Files
  * CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
  * run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s                 definition:
  * Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  * Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  * Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  * Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
  * From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each        subject.
  * TidyData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
